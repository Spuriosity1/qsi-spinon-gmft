# Spinon calculations for quantum spin ice in GMFT

Closely follows the work of FÃ©lix Desrochers and Yong Baek Kim, specifically the papers

1. [Symmetry fractionalization in the gauge mean-field theory of quantum spin ice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11243), and
2. [Spectroscopic signatures of fractionalization in octupolar quantum spin ice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05240).

Stable versions of the important functions are found in `SpinonStructure.jl`. 

The Jupyter notebook `spinon-develop.ipynb` contains explicit expressions explaining what these functions do, and is used for development and benchmarking.
